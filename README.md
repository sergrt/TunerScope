# TunerScope

TunerScope is an application that visualizes the audio spectrum and precisely detects the musical note, showing pitch deviation in cents.
### Features
- Real-time spectrum display
- High-accuracy note detection
- Flexible configuration (FFT size, sample rate, sample format, etc.)

While there are many tuners available (especially for guitar), very few provide spectrum visualization.
TunerScope offers an easy and convenient way to analyze the harmonics of a guitar or pickup without the need for a full DAW.

### It can also be used as:
- A precise tuner
- A vocal pitch training tool with instant feedback
- A spectrum analyzer for any input source: microphone, audio interface, loopback, etc.

### Example Use Cases
- Instrument comparison: a dull-sounding guitar shows fewer harmonics; old strings and cheap pickups are immediately visible
- Dead spot testing: quickly identify problematic frets on an instrument
- Vocal training: sing and instantly check how accurately youâ€™re hitting the pitch
- Instrument tuning: precise tuner with visual deviation in cents

## Settings

The settings window allows you to:
- Select an audio input device
- Configure processing parameters (FFT size, sample rate, sample format, etc.)
